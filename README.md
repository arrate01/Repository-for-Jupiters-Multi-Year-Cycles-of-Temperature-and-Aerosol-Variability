# Repository-for-Jupiters-Multi-Year-Cycles-of-Temperature-and-Aerosol-Variability

Antuñano et al. (2023) used ground-based mid-infrared (7.9-24.5 µm) images acquired between 1983 and 2019 using the BOLO-
93 1 (1983-1993), MIRAC (1993-1999), MIRLIN (1996-2003) and MIRSI (2003-2011) instruments mounted at the 3-m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Hawai'i; the VISIR (2006-2011, 2016-2018) instrument mounted at the 8-m Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile; and the COMICS (2005-2019) instrument on the 8-m Subaru Telescope in Hawai'i.

This repository contains all the smoothed radiance profiles used in Antuñano et al. (2023) to compute (i) the smoothed zonal-mean brightness temperatures as a function of latitude and date, and (ii) spectral image cubes to derive the vertical profile of temperature and aerosols. It also contains the retrieved temperatures and aerosol opacity shown and discussed in Antuñano et al. (2023).
